# XRD Converter

Video Example: https://youtu.be/qTCuPCO7a90

NEW -> use `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This program takes a folder of raw .out xrd files and removes the header, generates a csv, and adds all xrd files to an xlsx worksheet


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

put all `.out` files in a folder to reference in the program

## Running the tests

To ensure that all modules are loaded and everything is working. Launch the program, If it launches with no errors, it is working properly 

## Running the program

Video Example: https://youtu.be/qTCuPCO7a90

The best way to install and run the program is to clone this repo to your home directory by typing `git clone https://github.com/Jobenland/XRD-Convert`. Once the directory has been cloned, change the directory `cd XRD-Convert` to the directory of the repository. Ensure you are in the directory by typing `dir` and checking the output for a file called `XRDConvert.py`. Type `python --version` or `python3 -version` and ensure the output version is at least 3.x.
